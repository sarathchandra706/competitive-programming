# ishappynumber(n) [10 pts]
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the 
# number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will 
# stay ), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 
# are happy numbers.

# Write the function ishappynumber(n) which takes a possibly-negative integer and returns True if it is happy and 
# False otherwise. Note that all numbers less than 1 are not happy. Here are some test assertions for you:
# assert(ishappynumber(-7) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(1) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(2) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(97) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(98) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(404) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(405) == False)
